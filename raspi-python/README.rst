The RasPi module provides access to peripheral devices (camera, distance sensor, temp sensor, accelerometer), an on-board database as well 
as computing power in the form of a CPU. It may provide additional services leveraged by use of an optional SenseHat. 
Each of the services is an instance of a HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) that allows a RasberryPi service/device to be compeltely
simluated for testing.
